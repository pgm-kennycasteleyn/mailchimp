            <p>
                For the assignment, I created a survey for my portfolio and see what other people think of it.

                After making the survey, I sent an e-mail to everyone from the PGM-group, both classmates and teachers Lennart & Claire.

                Out of 34 people, 12 people responded and answered the survey.

                Out of the 12 responses, 2 responses skipped over the final two questions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's have a look at the results of the survey:

            <p>
                By the looks of it, it seems that 41.7% doesn't know if the website is easily accessible to them. While 33.3% thinks it is not accessible, and 25% does find it accessible to go to.

            <p>
                Here you can see many people ask for more pictures or a link to the page itself, while some don't seem to understand the language or concept.

                At question 3, it seems most people have given it a 5/10, with only 1 person giving a 3/10, 4/10 and 7/10, and 3 people giving it a 6/10. There seems to still be some work done before finishing.

            <p>
                By the looks of the last question, it seems 70% of the people are interested to see my company go international, especially towards the Japanese market, while 30% are not really sure why I would be going international.
            </p>
            <p>
                My honest opinion is, I would be going international, most commonly in Japan, so I can start focusing on more interesting assignments and start working on webpages for the Japanese people, especially for idol companies in Japan.

        <h2>
            Conclusion?
        </h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                My conclusion is that I still have a lot of work left to do before I can finish my portfolio and have my own company, which I still dream of expanding to the Japanese market. You can expect the end-result in the coming weeks, while taking your opinions and the results of this survey into consideration. I thank you all for your time and patience and for answering the survey.
